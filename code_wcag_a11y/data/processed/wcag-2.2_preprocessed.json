Controls, Input If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.) Time-Based Media If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.) Test If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. Sensory If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. CAPTCHA If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

Examples include sliders, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.

          "Text alternatives that are \"consistent\" are not always \"identical.\" For instance, you may have a graphical arrow at the bottom of a web page that links to the next web page. The text alternative may say \"Go to page 4.\" Naturally, it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next web page. It would be more appropriate to say \"Go to page 5\". Although these text alternatives would not be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this success criterion. A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the web page. A check mark icon may function as \"approved\", \"completed\", or \"included\", to name a few, depending on the situation. Using \"check mark\" as text alternative across all web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions."

Note 1 Help mechanisms may be provided directly on the page, or may be provided via a direct link to a different page containing the information. Note 2 For this success criterion, \"the same order relative to other page content\" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the page is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the page's zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different page variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across pages displayed in the same page variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).\n\nSufficient Techniques (Ways to Pass):\nG220: Provide a contact-us link in a consistent location\n\nCommon Failures (QA Checkpoints):\nInconsistent Help Location",

This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the human language(s) of the content, AND The web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users. This means that at least one of the following four statements is true: The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS); OR The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported; OR The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported; OR The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that: does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability and is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities. Note 1 The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for \"Accessibility Support\" .) Note 2 Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not relied upon and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including Conformance Requirement 4 and Conformance Requirement 5 . Note 3 When a web technology is used in a way that is \"accessibility supported,\" it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML , lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements. Note 4 When citing web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified. Note 5 One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses .) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above."

Note 2 Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs. Note 3 The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles. Example Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following: screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images; screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille; text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech; speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities; alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.); alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations."

Note 1 For general software or web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds. Note 2 A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions. Note 3 The new working definition in the field for \"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\" (from WCAG 2.2) is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. [ ISO_9241-391 ] Note 4 Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above)."

Note 2 Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user. Note 3 The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings. Note 4 When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion. Note 5 The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the \"equivalent\" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size."

Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 . Note 4 If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).

Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports. Note 2 This definition is based on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary [ UAAG10 ]."

    "text": "Definition: web page - a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent Note 1 Although any \"other resources\" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other. Note 2 For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be \"non-embedded\" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page. Example 1 A web resource including all embedded images and media. Example 2 A web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole. Example 3 A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules. Example 4 When you enter \"http://shopping.example.com/\" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page website or just one page within a website."
